GitHub checkout from https://github.com/jwdj/EasyABC

This is notionally 1.3.7.8, but has been for some time. A 1.3.7.8 Windows version has been released, and my late 2019 port for
64-bit MacOS was based on an early version of this source code. My late 2020 work is based on 2020-10-10 version of the code
which forms the Windows release.

Python 3 from HomeBrew Python 3.8.5

Virtual env ./venv

Added wxpython and py2app using pip

Will run with python3 easy_abc.py


Utility programs via The ABC Plus Project http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/ :

   abc2midi/midi2abc/abc2abc from https://sourceforge.net/projects/abcplus/files/abcMIDI/abcmidi-20201012-osx.zip

   abcm2ps from https://sourceforge.net/projects/abcplus/files/abcm2ps/abcm2ps-8.14.10-osx.zip/download

   nwc2xml from https://code.google.com/archive/p/nwc2xml/downloads (nwc2xml-osx-1.5.0.5.zip)

Pango, or not Pango?

Starts up from the command line.

abcm2ps (and probably the rest) fail to run because "“abcm2ps” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." Explicitly opening them in the Finder sorts this,
but how do we deal with this for general users?

Reports "Warning: pygame/pypm module not found. Recording midi will not work"

Loads ABC file. Fails to play it with expected 'Unsupported format message.'

Throws various "wx._core.wxAssertionError: C++ assertion "retval != __null" failed at /Users/robind/projects/bb2/dist-osx-py38/build/ext/wxWidgets/src/osx/carbon/graphics.cpp(116) in wxMacCreateCGColor():" errors.

Needs PR#30 fix to prevent exception in svgrender when using wxPython 4.1 under MacOS (at least).

Copy fluidsynth library 2.1.2 (or was that 2.0.5?) from HomeBrew (can't upgrade without
upgrading Python..)

  cp /usr/local/Cellar/fluid-synth/2.0.5/lib/libfluidsynth.2.1.2.dylib .

Set this up in fluidsynth.py

Diagnose Segmentation fault errors by runnign with `python3 -X faulthandler`

Code uses `F.fluid_file_set_qual()` but it doesn't exist as an entrypoint? Commented out for the moment.

Sound works.

SoundFont is configurable, but it's only used at startup so changes get ignored until you quit and restart.
A particular problem if you didn't have a soundfont to start with because MacOS fails to play anything
under these circumstances.







Need to remove 'email' from 'excludes' list in setup.py because urllib 

$ bash build.sh

Workaround 1:

cd dist/EasyABC.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload/wx/
ln -s ../../../../../Frameworks/libwx_osx_cocoau_core-3.0.0.4.0.dylib libwx_osx_cocoau_core-3.0.0.4.0.dylib
ln -s ../../../../../Frameworks/libwx_baseu_net-3.0.0.4.0.dylib libwx_baseu_net-3.0.0.4.0.dylib
ln -s ../../../../../Frameworks/libwx_baseu-3.0.0.4.0.dylib libwx_baseu-3.0.0.4.0.dylib
ln -s ../../../../../Frameworks/libwx_osx_cocoau_html-3.0.0.4.0.dylib libwx_osx_cocoau_html-3.0.0.4.0.dylib
ln -s ../../../../../Frameworks/libwx_osx_cocoau_stc-3.0.0.4.0.dylib libwx_osx_cocoau_stc-3.0.0.4.0.dylib
ln -s ../../../../../Frameworks/libwx_osx_cocoau_media-3.0.0.4.0.dylib libwx_osx_cocoau_media-3.0.0.4.0.dylib

Workaround 2:

Add --packages=wx to build (but makes the result larger)

Either way seems to hang si=ometime after "Warning: pygame/pypm module not found. Recording midi will not work"
